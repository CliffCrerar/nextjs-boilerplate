		The purpose of this amalgamation mainly are base upon development goals:

	par2: 'Next.js plays the most critical role in this partnership. It provides the means to quickly put together a react application that is light, and much lighter than other react boilers. Next.js also allows for almost pure CSS writing inside the same file as react which is not available in the create react app.',
	par4: "Bootstrap has long since been on the lips of every developer when talking about style libraries, its classes helped developers save much time on styling pure HTML by just adding pre existing classes. You will not find the entire bootstrap library in this framework but only the helper classes that you can find in the utilities section of the Bootstrap 4 site. Bootstrap styles have since become legacy but these these classes are so useful due to saving time for creating classes for text-alignment, applying flex-box, margin and padding, you can do it on the fly without needing to add dirty inline style nor create new classes. And using these classes also bring consistency to you app.",
	par5: "The final piece of the puzzle is brought in by the materialize-css library, A simple yet extremely modern material design style library which is reminiscent of the Bootstrap style library in the fact that it is a pure CSS style library which means you still have full control over how the html will behave and this is a aspect the component based style libraries take away from the developer, although these pre-built components are in-fact also extremely useful and provide much functionality out of the box, it also brings rigidity.",
	par: "In this quick launch application you will find all you need to code in your favorite framework, control the structure completely, you will be able to scaffold great apps in the least amount of time while still being able to express yourself creatively."
