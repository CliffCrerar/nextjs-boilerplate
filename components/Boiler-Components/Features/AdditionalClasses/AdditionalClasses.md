Materialize CSS library has their own set of helper classes that are included so these are also available for use. Please see the [materialize-css](https://materializecss.com/getting-started.html) library documents for more details.

Then there are some custom classes that have been added to make up for where bootstrap leaves of, this is a catalogue of helper classes added to supplement the bootstrap helpers.

#### Typography

When you add the class `mnext` to any of the heading tags `h1 h2 h3h h4 h5 h6` then your your html will adopt the theme colors as follows.

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
##### Heading 6

#### 3D Floating objects

furthermore when adding the class of `mnext-3d` to a element class will then transform the heading into a material next floating object. These headings were created to follow the material design principles of elevation and lighting. 

<h1 class="mnext">Heading 1</h1>
<h2 class="mnext">Heading 2</h2>
<h3 class="mnext">Heading 3</h3>
<h4 class="mnext">Heading 4</h4>
<h5 class="mnext">Heading 5</h5>
<h6 class="mnext">Heading 6</h6>
