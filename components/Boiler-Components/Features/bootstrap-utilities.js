			We have included in this library all the goodness of what Bootstrap has to offer, leaving out all the stuff that used to be nice, but is not so nice any longer.
		<br />
			<br />
			The great thing about Bootstrap 4 is that it provided all kinds of helper classes to which were just CSS classes pre scripted to help you have a better coding experience, so that you don't have to waste time to go and create a css class when you wanted add margin or padding, or just centering text.
